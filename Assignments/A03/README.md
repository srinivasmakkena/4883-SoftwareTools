### I have chosen FFMPEG, a powerful open-source multimedia framework. I specifically selected this topic because I have had firsthand experience using FFMPEG in my previous project, where I needed to handle various media data such as video frames and audio. FFMPEG proved to be an invaluable tool for manipulating, converting, and streaming multimedia content.
### FFMPEG offers a wide range of capabilities, including video and audio encoding, decoding, transcoding, filtering, and streaming. It supports a vast array of formats and codecs, making it highly versatile for handling diverse media requirements. Additionally, FFMPEG provides a command-line interface, which allows for efficient batch processing and automation.

### I have particularily chosen this tool since i used it before for my project for merging frames and audio from different source video formats.
