# My tool - FFMPEG

## A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.

### FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux,
### stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created. It supports 
### the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge. No matter if they were designed by some 
###  standards committee, the community or a corporation. It is also highly portable: FFmpeg compiles, 
###  runs, and passes our testing infrastructure FATE across Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, the BSDs, 
###  Solaris, etc. under a wide variety of build environments, machine architectures, and configurations.
